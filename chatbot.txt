Un chatbot (también conocido como talkbot, chatbot, bot, bot de mensajería instantánea, agente interactivo o entidad conversacional artificial) es un programa informático o una inteligencia artificial que lleva a cabo una conversación a través de métodos auditivos o textuales. Estos programas a menudo están diseñados para simular de manera convincente cómo se comportaría un ser humano como compañero de conversación, pasando así la prueba de Turing. Los chatbots se utilizan normalmente en sistemas de diálogo para diversos fines prácticos, incluido el servicio al cliente o la adquisición de información. Algunos chatterbots usan sofisticados sistemas de procesamiento de lenguaje natural, pero muchos sistemas más simples buscan palabras clave dentro de la entrada y luego obtienen una respuesta con las palabras clave más coincidentes, o el patrón de redacción más similar, de una base de datos.

The term "ChatterBot" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot, Julia) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs.Today, most chatbots are either accessed via virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, via messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger or WeChat, or via individual organizations' apps and websites. Chatbots can be classified into usage categories such as conversational commerce (e-commerce via chat), analytics, communication, customer support, design, developer tools, education, entertainment, finance, food, games, health, HR, marketing, news, personal, productivity, shopping, social, sports, travel and utilities.
Background
In 1950, Alan Turing's famous article "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" was published, which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence. This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge, sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably�on the basis of the conversational content alone�between the program and a real human. The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated great interest in Joseph Weizenbaum's program ELIZA, published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human. However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and the Introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:

[In] artificial intelligence ... machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained ... its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures ... The observer says to himself "I could have written that". With that thought he moves the program in question from the shelf marked "intelligent", to that reserved for curios ... The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be "explained". Few programs ever needed it more.

ELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of cue words or phrases in the input, and the output of corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY').Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial. ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate, because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are capable of being interpreted as "intelligent".

Interface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational�even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching�can be exploited for useful purposes. Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories. Thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a "friendlier" interface than a more formal search or menu system. This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum's "shelf ... reserved for curios" to that marked "genuinely useful computational methods".

Desarrollador
Los primeros chatbots históricos clásicos son ELIZA (1966) y PARRY (1972). Los programas notables más recientes incluyen A.L.I.C.E., Jabberwacky y D.U.D.E (Agence Nationale de la Recherche y CNRS 2006). Si bien ELIZA y PARRY se usaron exclusivamente para simular conversaciones mecanografiadas, muchos chatbots ahora incluyen características funcionales como juegos y capacidades de búsqueda en la web. En 1984, se publicó un libro llamado The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed, supuestamente escrito por el chatbot Racter (aunque el programa tal como se publicó no habría sido capaz de hacerlo).

Un campo pertinente de la investigación de la IA es el procesamiento del lenguaje natural. Por lo general, los campos de IA débiles emplean software especializado o lenguajes de programación creados específicamente para la función limitada requerida. Por ejemplo, A.L.I.C.E. utiliza un lenguaje de marcado llamado AIML, que es específico para su función como agente conversacional, y desde entonces ha sido adoptado por varios otros desarrolladores de los llamados Alicebots. Sin embargo, A.L.I.C.E. todavía se basa puramente en técnicas de coincidencia de patrones sin ninguna capacidad de razonamiento, la misma técnica que ELIZA estaba usando en 1966. Esta no es una IA fuerte, que requeriría sapiencia y habilidades de razonamiento lógico.

Jabberwacky aprende nuevas respuestas y contextos basados ​​en interacciones de usuario en tiempo real, en lugar de ser impulsado desde una base de datos estática. Algunos chatbots más recientes también combinan el aprendizaje en tiempo real con algoritmos evolutivos que optimizan su capacidad para comunicarse en función de cada conversación mantenida. Aún así, actualmente no existe una inteligencia artificial conversacional de propósito general, y algunos desarrolladores de software se enfocan en el aspecto práctico, la recuperación de información.

Las competiciones de chatbot se centran en la prueba de Turing o en objetivos más específicos. Dos de estos concursos anuales son el Premio Loebner y el Desafío Chatterbox (sin conexión desde 2015, todavía se pueden encontrar materiales en archivos web).

Según Forrester (2015), la inteligencia artificial reemplazará el 16 por ciento de los empleos estadounidenses para el final de la década. Los chatbots se han utilizado en aplicaciones como el servicio al cliente, las ventas y la educación sobre productos. Sin embargo, un estudio realizado por Narrative Science en 2015 encontró que el 80 por ciento de sus encuestados cree que la IA mejora el desempeño de los trabajadores y crea empleos.

Messaging apps
Many companies' chatbots run on messaging apps like Facebook Messenger (since 2016), WeChat (since 2013),WhatsApp, LiveChat, Kik, Slack, Line, Telegram, or simply via SMS. They are used for B2C customer service, sales and marketing.

In 2016, Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform. There were 30,000 bots created for Messenger in the first six months, rising to 100,000 by September 2017.

Since September 2017, this has also been as part of a pilot program on WhatsApp. Airlines KLM and Aerom�xico both announced their participation in the testing;both airlines had previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform.

The bots usually appear as one of the user's contacts, but can sometimes act as participants in a group chat.

Many banks and insurers, media and e-commerce companies, airlines and hotel chains, retailers, health care providers, government entities and restaurant chains have used chatbots to answer simple questions, increase customer engagement,for promotion, and to offer additional ways to order from them.

A 2017 study showed 4% of companies used chatbots.According to a 2016 study, 80% of businesses said they intended to have one by 2020.

As part of company apps and websites
Previous generations of chatbots were present on company websites, e.g. Ask Jenn from Alaska Airlines which debuted in 2008 or Expedia's virtual customer service agent which launched in 2011.The newer generation of chatbots includes IBM Watson-powered "Rocky", introduced in February 2017 by the New York City-based e-commerce company Rare Carat to provide information to prospective diamond buyers.

Company internal platforms
Other companies explore ways they can use chatbots internally, for example for Customer Support, Human Resources, or even in Internet-of-Things (IoT) projects. Overstock.com, for one, has reportedly launched a chatbot named Mila to automate certain simple yet time-consuming processes when requesting for a sick leave.Other large companies such as Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Renault and Citro�n are now using automated online assistants instead of call centres with humans to provide a first point of contact. A SaaS chatbot business ecosystem has been steadily growing since the F8 Conference when Zuckerberg unveiled that Messenger would allow chatbots into the app.

Toys
Chatbots have also been incorporated into devices not primarily meant for computing such as toys.

Hello Barbie is an Internet-connected version of the doll that uses a chatbot provided by the company ToyTalk,which previously used the chatbot for a range of smartphone-based characters for children.These characters' behaviors are constrained by a set of rules that in effect emulate a particular character and produce a storyline.

IBM's Watson computer has been used as the basis for chatbot-based educational toys for companies such as CogniToys intended to interact with children for educational purposes.

Chatbot creation
The process of creating a chatbot follows a pattern similar to the development of a web page or a mobile app. It can be divided into Design, Building, Analytics and Maintenance.

Design
The chatbot design is the process that defines the interaction between the user and the chatbot.The chatbot designer will define the chatbot personality, the questions that will be asked to the users, and the overall interaction.It can be viewed as a subset of the conversational design. In order to speed up this process, designers can use dedicated chatbot design tools, that allow for immediate preview, team collaboration and video export.An important part of the chatbot design is also centered around user testing. User testing can be performed following the same principles that guide the user testing of graphical interfaces.

Building
The process of building a chatbot can be divided into two main tasks: understanding the user's intent and producing the correct answer. The first task involves understanding the user input. In order to properly understand a user input in a free text form, a Natural Language Processing Engine can be used.The second task may involve different approaches depending on the type of the response that the chatbot will generate.

Analytics
The usage of the chatbot can be monitored in order to spot potential flaws or problems. It can also provide useful insights that can improve the final user experience.

Maintenance
To keep chatbots up to speed with changing company products and services, traditional chatbot development platforms require ongoing maintenance. This can either be in the form of an ongoing service provider or for larger enterprises in the form of an in-house chatbot training team.To eliminate these costs, some startups are experimenting with Artificial Intelligence to develop self-learning chatbots, particularly in Customer Service applications.

Chatbot development platforms
The process of building, testing and deploying chatbots can be done on cloud based chatbot development platforms offered by cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers such as Yekaliva, Oracle Cloud Platform, SnatchBot and IBM Watson.These cloud platforms provide Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence and Mobile Backend as a Service for chatbot development.

APIs
There are many APIs available for building your own chatbots, such as AARC.

Malicious use
Malicious chatbots are frequently used to fill chat rooms with spam and advertisements, by mimicking human behaviour and conversations or to entice people into revealing personal information, such as bank account numbers. They are commonly found on Yahoo! Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and other instant messaging protocols. There has also been a published report of a chatbot used in a fake personal ad on a dating service's website.
